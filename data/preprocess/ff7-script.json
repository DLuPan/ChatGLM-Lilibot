Choose which slot you want to put Materia in. Now select the Materia you want to use. This is curative Materia. If you want to know what its effect is, line the cursor up with [Check], and push the OK button. It's just like selecting battle commands. Just line the cursor up to [Magic], you can see that the available magic has increased. Now you can use new magic [Cure]. And that's all there is to equipping Materia. See? It wasn't that tough! When you want to remove any Materia, it's as easy as pointing to the materia slot, and pushing the triangle button. There's just one thing you have to be careful of. Whenever you equip Materia, your situation changes. Parts of you may become stronger... while others get weaker. Normally, when you equip [Magic] Materia, your magic power will get stronger. But your physical strength weakens. So, Materia's kind of a double-edged sword. On the left side of the screen, you can see the Materia's effect on you. It's wise not to overuse Magic Materia.
